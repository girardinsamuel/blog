By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
    Halloween.

    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

2. Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3. Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.
